Prayer and Peace be upon our \\nProphet Mohammed, His Comrades and Relatives.\\nIt gives me a great pleasure to present you with the annual report of Qatar First Investment \\nBank which reflects our major achievements during the second year of operations and the \\nfinancial highlights of the period ending 31st December 2010.\\nThe global economy started to show sluggish signs of recovery during 2010 as major \\nequity markets recovered parts of their losses, and other financial institutions managed \\nto rebuild their capital. This economic recovery varied according to regions. In advanced \\neconomies, recovery was slow compared to past standards, whilst in emerging economies, \\nthe recuperation was more vigorous.\\nThe GCC region has weathered the global meltdown exceptionally well. The respective \\ngovernments adopted prudent monetary and fiscal policies which supported economic \\ngrowth. As a result, GCC economies witnessed a better real GDP growth rates during 2010 \\npropelled by an increase in oil prices and the recovery of main export markets. \\nThe State of Qatar, continued its steady growth rate. The ongoing expansion of energy \\nrelated projects, coupled with the government’s support of the banking system and increase \\nin public expenditure helped maintain strong economic growth in 2010. This confidence was \\nfurther reinstated when Qatar was awarded the bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022. As \\na result, public expenditure is expected to reach approximately USD 65bn to be allocated \\nacross various sectors. This event will certainly attract more foreign capital to the country. \\nAs far as the Islamic financial industry is concerned, it still managed to undergo a period of \\nsustained growth recording a 20% increase in 2010. According to a study by Ernst & Young, \\nthe assets of the Islamic financial services sector are expected to reach a trillion dollars and \\nan increase in size to $ 25 billion in the year 2015. This indicates that there is a plenitude of \\nopportunities to capitalize on, as the Bank further cements its market position and continues \\nto strive to become the bank of choice for investors seeking opportunities in the region.  \\nDuring 2010 we continued to pursue our prudent investment strategy based on sector and \\ngeographic diversity. We focused on sectors that are benefiting from key drivers of economic \\nchange, including energy, financial services, industrials, real estate and health care services. \\nThese sectors are generally at an embryonic stage in our target markets and are primed to \\nbenefit substantially from the macroeconomic growth in the region that is fuelled by the \\nwealth of natural resources and increased government expenditure on development. \\nChairman’s Message\\nI am pleased to report that during the course of 2010, the Bank executed two deals in the \\nhealth care sector spanning two different geographies, Turkey and UAE. Meanwhile, we \\nexited one of our investments in the real estate sector.  In addition, all of our existing portfolio \\ncompanies are performing well which resulted in a year of strong growth for the Bank. Also, \\nfor the first time since our operations, we will distribute dividends to our shareholders. The \\ndistribution of a cash dividend of 5% of the nominal value of share capital is recommended \\nby the Board of Directors to the General Assembly.\\nIt seems that 2011 will be more challenging given the current political turmoil in the Middle \\nEast. The whole region is bound to witness changes on the political and economic fronts. \\nIn spite of this unstable situation, we remain optimistic, as with change opportunities will \\nsurface. We at QFIB are now more ready than ever to capture these opportunities. In the \\nmeantime, we are keeping a close eye on Qatar, as there will be ample opportunities for \\ninvestments across various sectors in light of winning the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World \\nCup. The Bank aims to play an active role in sourcing viable investment opportunities and \\nproviding services for investors that will maximize shareholders’ returns. \\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I take this opportunity to extend  my sincere appreciation \\nto His Highness the Emir, Sh. Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani and His Highness the Crown Prince \\nSh. Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani for their continuous support to the financial institutions in \\nthe State of Qatar. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholders \\nand business partners for their continuous loyalty and support; to our Shari’ah Supervisory \\nBoard for their wise council and guidance and to the bank’s management and staff for their \\ndedication and contribution to the success of the bank’s business plan.\\nMay Allah enlighten our path and bless us to realize our vision of becoming a leading \\nShari’ah compliant investment bank in the region.\\nAbdullah bin Fahad bin Ghorab Al Marri\\nChairman\\n10 | 11'},\n",
