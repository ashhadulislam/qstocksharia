Basis of preparation (continued)         \\n \\n(d) Use of estimates and judgements (continued)   \\n \\nGoing concern \\n \\nThe management has made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and is \\nsatisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. The Group has \\na positive working capital and net assets as at 31 December 2022. Furthermore, management is not aware of \\nany material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going \\nconcern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.  \\n \\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, and investment properties \\n \\nItems of property, plant and equipment , right-of-use assets, and investment propert ies are depreciated on a \\nstraight line basis over their estimated individual useful lives. Management exercises significant judgement for \\nthe determination of the depreciation method and the useful lives and residual values of these assets, including \\ntheir ex pected usage over their lives, the rate of their physical wear and tear, and their technological or \\ncommercial obsolescence. Such estimates could have a significant impact on the annual depreciation charge \\nrecognized in profit or loss.  \\n \\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets and investment properties \\n \\nThe carrying amounts of the Group’s property, plant and equipment , right -of-use assets , and investment \\nproperties are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is  any indication of impairment. \\nThat assessment requires judgement. As at the reporting date, management did not identify any evidence \\nfrom internal reporting indicating impairment of an asset or class of assets. \\n \\nProvision for impairment for slow moving and obsolete inventories \\n \\nWhen inventories become old or obsolete, an estimate is made of their net realizable value. For individually \\nsignificant amounts this estimation is performed on an individual basis. Amounts which are not individually \\nsignificant, but which are old or obsolete, are assessed collectively and a provision is applied according to the \\ninventory type and the degree of ageing or obsolescence. The necessity and setting up of a provision for slow \\nmoving and obsolete inventories requires considerable degree of judgment.  \\n \\nImpairment of receivable \\n \\nThe Group uses an expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model to determine the impairment of receivables. \\nThis impairment model requires forward looking information, which is based on assumptions for the future \\nmovement of different economic drivers and how these drivers will affect each other. It also requires \\nmanagement to assign probability of default to various categories of receivables.

This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains \\na contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet \\nthis condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:         \\n         \\n-    contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;       \\n-    terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable-rate features; \\n-    prepayment and extension features; and         \\n-    terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).   \\n \\nA prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment \\namount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, \\nwhich may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. \\n         \\nAdditionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature \\nthat permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substanti ally represents the contractual par amount \\nplus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for \\nearly termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment fea ture is \\ninsignificant at initial recognition.   \\n \\nFinancial assets - Subsequent measurement and gains and losses \\n         \\n- Financial assets at amortised cost - These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest method. Th e amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, \\nforeign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on \\nderecognition is recognised in profit or loss.         \\n         \\n-    Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) -These assets are subsequently measured \\nat fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or \\nloss.    \\n     \\n-    Debt instruments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - These assets are \\nsubsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, \\nforeign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognise d in profit or loss. Other net gains and \\nlosses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified \\nto profit or loss.   \\n        \\n-   Equity investments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - These assets are \\nsubsequently measured at fair value.

Significant accounting policies (continued) \\n \\nj) Impairment (continued) \\n \\nNon-derivative financial assets (continued) \\n \\nThe Group considers that it is not exposed to any credit risk with respect to its receivables from the Government \\nor their controlled entities.  \\n \\nFor the financial assets, except for the cash at bank, the Group applied the simplified approach to measuring \\nECLs which recognises the lifetime ECLs of these assets that reflect an increased credit risk. The maximum \\nperiod considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed \\nto credit risk. \\n \\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition \\nand when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supp ortable information that is relevant and \\navailable without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis \\nbased on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward lookin g \\ninformation. \\n \\nLoss allowances on bank balances are always measured at an amount equal to 12 -month ECLs. The Group \\nconsiders bank balances to have a low risk level when their credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally \\nunderstood definition of “investment grade”.  \\n \\nMeasurement of ECLs \\n \\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of \\nall cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract \\nand the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the \\nfinancial asset. \\n \\nCredit-impaired financial assets \\n \\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit -\\nimpaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the \\nestimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. \\n \\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: \\n \\n- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; \\n- a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 365 days past due; or  \\n- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider \\notherwise; \\n- it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or  \\n- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.  \\n \\nPresentation of loss allowance on financial assets in the statement of financial position \\n \\nAny loss allowance on financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying \\namount of the assets. \\n \\nWrite-off \\n \\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations \\nof recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. The Group individually makes an assessment \\nwith respect to the timing and amount of write -off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of \\nrecovery. The Group expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However, financial assets \\nthat are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s procedures \\nfor recovery of amounts due. \\n '},\n",

This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains \\na contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet \\nthis condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:         \\n         \\n-    contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;       \\n-    terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable-rate features; \\n-    prepayment and extension features; and         \\n-    terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).   \\n \\nA prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment \\namount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, \\nwhich may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. \\n         \\nAdditionally, for a financial asset acquired at a discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature \\nthat permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substanti ally represents the contractual par amount \\nplus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for \\nearly termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment fea ture is \\ninsignificant at initial recognition.   \\n \\nFinancial assets - Subsequent measurement and gains and losses \\n         \\n- Financial assets at amortised cost - These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using \\nthe effective interest method. Th e amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, \\nforeign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on \\nderecognition is recognised in profit or loss.         \\n         \\n-    Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) -These assets are subsequently measured \\nat fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or \\nloss.    \\n     \\n-    Debt instruments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - These assets are \\nsubsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, \\nforeign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognise d in profit or loss. Other net gains and \\nlosses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified \\nto profit or loss.   \\n        \\n-   Equity investments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) - These assets are \\nsubsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the \\ndividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses \\nare recognised in OCI and are never derecognised to profit or loss.

Capital management         \\n         \\nThe management's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and to sustain \\nfuture development of the business. The management mo nitors the capital, which the Group defines as total \\nshareholders' equity excluding cumulative changes in fair value reserve and is measured at QR 1,190,901,300 \\non 31 December 2022 (2021: QR 1,287,157,026). \\n        \\nThe Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in business \\nconditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to \\nshareholders, or increase capital. No changes were made in the objectives, policies  or process during the \\nyears 2022 and 2021.         \\n         \\nThe Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is debt divided by capital plus debt.
